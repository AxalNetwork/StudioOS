## 2026-05-15 — Task #17: Finalize HubSpot Private App connection

- Registry: `cloudflare-worker/src/integrations/registry.ts` — added
  `supports_pat: true` to the HubSpot descriptor (was previously only on
  Calendly), exposing the Private-App path through
  `publicDescriptor()` → `/api/integrations/available`.
- Modal (`frontend/src/pages/IntegrationsPage.jsx`):
  - PAT field label, placeholder (`pat-na1-...`), and helper text are
    HubSpot-aware (point to "Settings → Integrations → Private Apps"
    with the required `crm.objects.deals.read/write` +
    `crm.objects.contacts.read` scopes).
  - OAuth blurb explains why PAT is the recommended path while the
    public app is pending HubSpot Marketplace review.
  - Connect submit button is always rendered for PAT-capable OAuth
    providers (no client-side gating on `apiKey`); backend handles
    validation and returns canonical error codes.
  - `ConnectModal.submit()` awaits `onSubmit` and catches; parent
    `onConnect()` re-throws non-402 errors so worker errors
    (`hubspot_invalid_private_app_token`,
    `hubspot_requires_oauth_code_or_pat`) render inline in the modal's
    red banner instead of being lost behind the overlay.
- `replit.md`: new gotcha under **Persistent gotchas → Frontend**
  ("Integrations Connect modal") documenting the registry flag, modal
  error-bubble contract, and HubSpot dual-auth backend contract.
- No backend logic change — `providers/hubspot.ts::connect()` already
  branches on `input.api_key` first, and `getActiveAccessToken()`
  short-circuits the refresh path for `is_private_app: true` rows.

Validation: `npm run test:drift` passes (9/9). Worker deployed as
`01b041d0-08e2-4ec9-b267-7ee11a64a84f`.
